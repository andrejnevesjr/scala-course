# Lightbend Scala Language - Professional

## Introduction

This self-paced course is also taught by instructors in a classroom setting over two days. The following presentation video introduces the course as it would be taught by an instructor in a classroom. The information is still relevant for this self-paced version. It's estimated that it will take between 10-12 hours of self-paced study to complete this course.

## My personal touch

I've using this course to refresh all Scala concepts and practice a little bit with this amazing language. Probably you are going to see that inside the course one bundle is offered to be used during the classes but I chose to create my own project from scratch.

## First steps

Within the repository structure, you can find the build.sbt with all dependencies required to play with on Visual Studio Code.

## Basic SBT commands

Clean project

```
sbt clean
```

Compiles the code and check for issues.

```
sbt compile
```

Create output package (In my case fatjar)

```
sbt package

```
